# homebridge-parrot-flower

[FranÃ§ais](README_FR.md) ðŸ‘ˆ

Warning: this project is a fork of [@grover's homebridge-flower-sensor project](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-flower-sensor).

Integrate [Parrot Flower Power](https://www.parrot.com/us/connected-garden/parrot-pot#parrot-pot), the [Parrot Pot](https://www.parrot.com/us/connected-garden/parrot-pot#parrot-pot) or the never released [Parrot H2O](http://blog.parrot.com/2015/01/05/ces-2015-flower-power-h2o/) into HomeKit using [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge). This plugin does not depend upon the now discontinued [Parrot Cloud](https://community.smartthings.com/t/parrot-flower-power-discontinued/78929) by talking directly to the sensors using a Bluetooth Low Energy connection.

## Capabilities

This plugin exposes the following capabilities of the Flower Power sensor to HomeKit:

* Soil Temperature
* Soil Moisture
* Ambient Light Level
* Identifying the sensor flashes the built-in LED
* Monitor the battery status of the Flower Power sensor
* Provides date/time the sensor data was last retrieved
* Provides the date/time the batteries were last changed
* 24h average low light level sensor trigger for plant recommendations
* 24h average low humidity level sensor trigger to remind you to water your plants

These capabilities are specific to the Parrot Pot:

* Start watering
* In Elgato Eve, see the type of program (manual or automatic) for watering. (Accessory type Irrigation system)

There're more capabilities planned for the future. And see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for release information.

## Using this plugin

To use this plugin I recommend a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). You can monitor multiple Flower Power devices in one homebridge on one Raspberry Pi Zero W.

* [Install on a Raspberry Pi](docs/raspberrypi.md)
* [Install on a Mac](docs/macos.md)
* [Add Flower Power sensors to HomeKit](docs/configure.md)

Please be aware of the [limitations and coexistance](docs/limitations.md) with other plugins using Bluetooth:

## Supported clients

This platform and the switches it creates have been verified to work with the following apps on iOS 11 (tested on iOS 13.4.1):

* Home
* Elgato Eve

See [HomeKit Apps](docs/apps.md) for a comparison table of supported features.
