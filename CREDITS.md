homebridge-flower-sensor wouldn't be possible without the work done by others. In no specific order:

* [@sandeepmistry](https://github.com/sandeepmistry)

  * For the [noble](https://github.com/noble/noble) implementation that provides access to Bluetooth devices
  * For the [node-flower-power](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/node-flower-power) library

* [@BuBuaBu](https://github.com/BuBuaBu)

  * For the [flower-power-history](https://github.com/BuBuaBu/flower-power-history) library

* [@Parrot-Developers](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers)

  * For their fork of the [node-flower-power package](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/node-flower-power) that added lots of little details
  * Lots of other bits and pieces
  * Obviously the devices themselves, but if you drop support, you should at least open source them! Please?
